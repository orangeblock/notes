# Slow comprehensive nmap scan
The scan can be said to be a "Intense scan plus UDP" plus some extras features. It will put a whole lot of effort into host detection, not giving up if the initial ping request fails. It uses three different protocols in order to detect the hosts; TCP, UDP and SCTP. If a host is detected it will do its best in determining what OS, services and versions the host are running based on the most common TCP and UDP services. Also the scan camouflages itself as source port 53 (DNS).
